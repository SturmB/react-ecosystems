# React Ecosystems

This is a project that was built while following along with the [Building Modern Projects with React][linkedin] course on LinkedIn Learning. It was not created with [create-react-app][cra] but rather from scratch.

It primarily serves as a reference for how to integrate React with [Redux][redux], [Thunk][thunk], and [styled-components][sc]. It also has some basic tests using [Mocha][mocha] and [Chai][chai], along with many other libraries.
